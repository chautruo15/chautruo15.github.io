        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>
            Throughout my time as an undergrad, I have engaged in various 
            research projects within the Department of Physics at Princeton University.
        </p>

        <p>
            As a summer intern at the Princeton Gravity Initiative from June to July 2023, 
            I worked under Dr. Delilah Gates and studied X-ray reflection spectroscopy, 
            a technique used to measure the spin of a black hole (BH) that involves 
            simulating and observing the Fe-K&alpha; line emission from the BH’s accretion disk. 
            My project focused on modeling these broadened emission spectra using the open-source 
            code Adaptive Analytical Ray Tracing (AART). AART simulates high-resolution images 
            of BH accretion disks, calculating the disk radius from which observed photons 
            were emitted and the redshift factor of the photons at each pixel on the image. 
            Using these values obtained from AART, I implemented code to calculate the resulting 
            emission spectrum for a given set of disk parameters, such as the BH spin and the 
            inclination angle of the observer. To decrease the runtime when computing the spectra, 
            I also helped to alter AART to create a polar grid rather than a Cartesian grid 
            when simulating images. This research was extended into my Junior Fall Independent Work, 
            where I modeled spectra for the accretion disk model of sub-Keplerian flow, in which the angular 
            momentum from the standard model of circular Keplerian flow is rescaled. 
        </p>

        <p>
            For my Junior Spring Independent Work, I worked under Professor Adam Burrows 
            from the Department of Astrophysical Sciences to study the long-term stability 
            and evolution of compact multi-planet systems. Using REBOUND, an open-source N-body code, 
            I simulated the evolution of various planetary systems, modeling the time to instability 
            as a function of the initial orbital separation between planets. Additionally, I examined 
            the semi-major axes and orbital eccentricities of the planets to identify ejections and uncover 
            trends that might predict when and how these ejections occur.
        </p>

        <p>
            During the summer of 2024, under the guidance of Dr. Alejandro Cárdenas-Avendaño at the 
            Princeton Gravity Initiative, I developed code in Julia to calculate the inspiral orbit 
            and gravitational waveforms of extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) systems using the numerical 
            kludge method. Beginning with code to integrate the geodesic equations, I expanded it to 
            incorporate radiation force calculations, allowing me to model the inspiral. I then extended 
            the code to compute the gravitational waveform and produce its “audio,” ultimately creating 
            animations of the inspiral orbits with the sonified waveforms. 
            <a href="#animations" class="active" style="color: #97d2e5">Below</a> are examples of the 
            animations I produced.
        </p>

        <p> 
            For my Senior Thesis, I am collaborating with Professor James Stone at the Institute for 
            Advanced Study and Hengrui Zhu at the Princeton Gravity Initiative to implement 
            algorithmic improvements to the moving-puncture approach for binary black hole (BBH) 
            simulations within the AthenaK framework, a modern implementation of Athena++. 
            The project focuses on enhancing the slow-start lapse technique to improve the 
            accuracy and stability of BBH simulations.

        <h2>Animations</h2>
        <p>
            The following animations showcase the inspiral orbits and 
            gravitational waveforms of EMRI systems that I produced during 
            my summer research at the Princeton Gravity Initiative from June 
            to July 2024. In developing these, I implemented the numerical 
            kludge method to simulate the inspiral and calculate the waveform, 
            which I then sonified to reflect the frequency evolution over time. 
            These animations combine a visual representation of the orbit and 
            the corresponding sound, offering an engaging perspective on the 
            dynamics of EMRI systems.

                waveform’s frequency evolution. Due to the more eccentric 
                orbit of this system, the waveform shows sharp pulses at 
                each pericenter passage, producing a distinct “spiking” 
                effect in the audio.
